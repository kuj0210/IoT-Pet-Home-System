# Domain setting description

The manual covers domain address changes, which is a must go process before HTTP is dismissed as HTTPS.<br/>
It also refers to how to use the "[freenom](https://my.freenom.com/clientarea.php)" site to change the domain address to handle the process. <br/>
If you have a certified IP, you can go through this process. (See [this description](https://github.com/kuj0210/IoT-Pet-Home-System/blob/master/.README/Notes/AWS_EC2_setting.md) if you don't have a qualified IP.)


## 1. Sign up

<img01 : Sign up page>

- You can sign up here, but I'll sign in with my Google account.
- Although there are several conditions and payment methods when signing up as a member, <br/>
  you can choose that part of the service voluntarily.
  

## 2. Find domain

<img02 : Select "Register a New Domain" category.>

- In the upper right corner, the menu " Services " appears. From here, click the "Register a New Domain" category.

<img03 : Find your new domain.>

- The process is to find out if a domain is available. Just write down the domain address you want.
- However, because some domains are charged, avoid typing in the end (such as ".com",".net") if possible.
- The writer's case was referred to as "testfreenommm".

<img04 : Free Domains Available>

- When you write down your domain, you can see the following available domains.
- Some domains are free, such as the screenshot above, but you can also use a paid domain if you prefer.

<img05 : Click this!>

- If you are interested in a domain, click on " Get it now! " and see the red sign in the screenshot above.


## 3. Regist your IP address

<img06 : Let's put in the public IP you have.>

- As with the screenshot above, there is a column for entering the IP address corresponding to the host name<br/>
  and the location for the time period to use.
- Usually, a free domain can be used for up to 12 months at no cost.
- The IP address box must contain your public IP.

<img src = "https://github.com/kuj0210/IoT-Pet-Home-System/blob/master/.README/Notes/freenom_img08.PNG">

<img07,08 : Confirm and enter details>

- Let's see how much it will cost as shown above. (Free in the case above.)
- Entering your details will finish the domain registration.

<img09 : Registered your domain>

- Like the screenshot above, you can check the domain address.



## Finally..

 We came to the point where we were about to use HTTPS. I hope you remember the domain address well<br/>
and I will finish explaining how to set up the domain address. Next, we will explain how to issue SSL certificates.
